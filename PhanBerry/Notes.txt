Blackberry Enterprise Server Limitations

By default, the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) limits the response size of a single HTTP response to 128K.
If you try to fetch anything bigger your application will receive a 413 (Request Entity Too Large) response code.
To get around this you must use the BES management console to change the value of the Maximum number of kilobytes
per connection field to a higher value, up to 1024K. 
Note that this limit also applies to the MDS simulator, so you'll need to change the simulator's settings as well.
Edit the mds\config\rimpublic.property file in your JDE installation directory and change the value of the
IPPP.connection.MaxNumberOfKBytesToSend property to match the BES setting and then restart the simulator.
